Part B: Create a new github repo called 'flask-bootstrap': 

Please follow along with lecture slides wk3c for tutorial associated with this assignment. 

Inside of the repo, please create at least 2 pages that are styled using BOOTSTRAP. Each of the pages at a minimum should contain: 
- static text (e.g., headers or paragraphs) 
- a button (does not need to be functional)
- and one other 'component' from boostrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/)

ERRORS:
 Was unable to use link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='bootstrap.css') }}". 
 
 When I had a static folder and template folder connected via the (link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='bootstrap.css') }}") code, 
 the styles would not show up on the webpage.
 
 However, when I used link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css" with the bootsrap.css file located in the 
 same folder as my html files, the styles showed up.
 
 Could not find a solution for this.
