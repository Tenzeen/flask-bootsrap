# flask-bootsrap
 Was unable to use link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='bootstrap.css') }}". 
 
 When I had a static folder and template folder connected via the (link rel=...) code, 
 the styles would not show up on the webpage.
 
 However, when I used link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css" with the bootsrap.css file located in the 
 same folder as my html files, the styles showed up.
 
 Could not find a solution for this.
